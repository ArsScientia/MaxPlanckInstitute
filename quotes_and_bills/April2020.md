It is a pleasure to provide you a quote for graphic design services related to your scientific publication.
The cost for each graphic design is 100 euros, with the posibility of multiple iterations and corrections until you reach satisfaction.
The final designs will be provided in the original sources files .svg as well as in final .png and .pdf formats.

I am looking forward to hearing from you.
